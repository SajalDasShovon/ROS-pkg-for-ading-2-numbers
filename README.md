# ROS-pkg-for-ading-2-numbers


A package to visualize Publisher and Subscriber (Python). 

here is the image of ROS publisher & subscriber. 

int_publisher is the publisher node & int_subscriber is the subscriber node.
Both are connected through num_print topic.

publisher sets the data to 20 & reading this data the subscriber adds 10 to it.

hence publusher is printing 20 & subscriber is printing 30.
